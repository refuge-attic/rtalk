# How to (re)build the Javascript from the C sources

You will *not* need to do this for a fresh checkout, since the project
policy is to include the generated javascript as a checked-in file.

## Ingredients

 - Python 2.x
 - a recent Emscripten, which in turn has dependencies on:
    - LLVM 3.2
    - Clang 3.2
    - Node.js 0.6.12 or newer
    - Python 2.7.3

Within the `js-nacl` directory,

 - [`import.py`](import.py) massages an unpacked `nacl` tarball,
   extracting just the reference implementations of the various
   algorithms. (See its
   [origin](https://github.com/warner/pynacl/blob/minimal/import.py)
   in Brian Warner's `minimal` branch of pynacl.)

 - [`keys.c`](keys.c) extends core `nacl` with a pynacl-compatible
   implementation of `crypto_sign_keypair_from_raw_sk`, the foundation
   for `nacl.crypto_sign_keypair_from_seed`.

 - [`nacl_cooked.js`](nacl_cooked.js) is the high-level Javascript
   interface to the low-level code.

 - [`nacl_cooked_prefix.js`](nacl_cooked_prefix.js) and
   [`nacl_cooked_suffix.js`](nacl_cooked_suffix.js) are wrapped
   around `nacl_cooked.js` and `nacl_raw.js` to create
   `lib/nacl.js`.

 - [`nacl_randombytes_emscripten.js`](nacl_randombytes_emscripten.js) is
   infrastructure for making the Emscripten-compiled library
   parameterized in its source of randomness.

 - [`test_nacl_browser.html`](test_nacl_browser.html) is a simple
   example/test of the code running in the browser.

 - [`test_nacl_node.js`](test_nacl_node.js) is a simple example/test
   for running in node.js: `node test_nacl_node.js`.

 - Both of the previous two depend upon
   [`test_nacl.js`](test_nacl.js), which contains the actual test
   script.

 - [`benchmark.html`](benchmark.html) and
   [`benchmark.js`](benchmark.js) are trivial speed measurements for
   running in the browser.

## Method

Follow the instructions from the [Emscripten
tutorial](http://emscripten.org/Tutorial) to get Emscripten ready to
run.

Once `emcc` is on your `$PATH` somewhere, use the `js-nacl` Makefile.

To rebuild everything:

    make veryclean all

This will completely remove any compilation products, and recompile
everything.

Other Makefile targets:

 - `make clean`: removes generated Javascript, but does not remove the
   unpacked and pre-processed `nacl` tarball contents.

 - `make veryclean`: as `make clean`, but also removes the `subnacl`
   directory and the contents of the `nacl` tarball.

 - `make` or `make all`: performs all the build steps.

If you for some reason need to use a different python than `python`,
set the `PYTHON` makefile variable; for example,

    make all PYTHON=python2.7

Similarly, set `EMCC` to the path to your `emcc` binary if it's not on
your `$PATH`.

## Serves three

The build products will be in

 - [`node_raw.js`](node_raw.js): output from Emscripten

 - `lib/*`: Javascript for use in the browser and in node.js

 - `subnacl/*`: Unpacked `nacl` tarball, after processing by `import.py`
